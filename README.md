# chatapp

A new Flutter project.

To get started: 

1. Go do the firebase console and set up a new project
2. Run `flutterfire configure`

This project is a working example of a very simple chat app that can be built in a one hour Flutter Workshop.

The workshop was first presented by 
[Brad McHelem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/branden-mc-helem-7b6b6b122/) and [Sylvia Dieckmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sylviadieckmann/) at [GDCS DevFest 2023](https://gdsc.community.dev/events/details/developer-student-clubs-university-of-cape-town-presents-break-the-rules-x-devfest-cape-town-student-edition/)
